# LSBUCruiseLiner Case Study C

## We are each given a case study where we have to:
><ol>
<li>Design an ERD of the system</li>
<li>Produce a complete set of functional dependencies for the system</li>
<li>Create the database in a suitable relational database software (MS SQL Server)</li>
<li>Insert test data into the database</li>
<li>Write a query to show details of reservation clerks, including their location and the number of reservations taken, specifically for those employees who have taken the highest and the lowest total number of reservations</li>
<li>Write a query to calculate individual totals for the number of complete, incomplete and cancelled reservations</li>
<li>Write a query to find the details of the passenger cabins that are available for booking on each voyage</li>
<li>Implement using triggers and/or stored procedures automatic prevention of double booking passenger cabins during the reservation process</li>
<li>Write a stored procedure that can generate a complete reservation slip/invoice for any customer. This invoice must include customer details, details & quantities of all food/item/services purchased, invoice totals before and after VAT (@ 20%) has been added</li>
<li>Produce a dashboard combining 4-6 visualized elements that can be used to tell an effective story about the business in the scenario</li>
<li>Record a video demo (10 mins maximum) of the queries and the dashboard where during the video, we must demonstrate live execution of both the queries and the dashboard</li>
</ol>
